# 🚀 Career Transition Portfolio

**A comprehensive full-stack platform I built to manage my career transition into software development. This project demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and deploy production-ready applications.**

## 🎯 **Live Application**
**🌐 [View Live Portfolio Platform](https://your-railway-url.railway.app)** *(Replace with your actual Railway URL)*

## 👨‍💻 **About This Project**
I created this platform to solve a real problem I faced during my career transition - the need for a comprehensive tool to manage portfolio projects, track job applications, and showcase my development skills to potential employers. This project itself serves as a demonstration of my full-stack development capabilities.

**This is my personal portfolio platform** - while the code is open source for learning purposes, the live application showcases my unique projects and career journey.

## 💼 **What This Demonstrates**
- **Full-Stack Development**: React frontend with Node.js/Express backend
- **Database Design**: Prisma ORM with relational database modeling
- **Authentication & Security**: JWT implementation with bcrypt password hashing
- **Production Deployment**: Docker containerization and cloud deployment
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing with Jest and Cypress
- **Project Management**: From requirements gathering to production deployment

## 🚀 Deploy to Web (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/Jathow
2. Click **"New"** → Create repository: `career-transition-portfolio`
3. Make it **Public**
4. Upload your code:
```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Jathow/career-transition-portfolio.git
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. **"Login with GitHub"** → **"New Project"** → **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Select `career-transition-portfolio`
4. Add environment variables (replace with your actual values):
```
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-super-long-random-jwt-secret-key-here-make-it-64-characters
DATABASE_URL=file:./prisma/prod.db
PORT=5001
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-actual-railway-url.railway.app
```

**Important:** Replace `your-email@gmail.com` and `your-secure-password` with your actual credentials!

### Step 3: Configure Project
Add `railway.json` to your project root:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": { "builder": "NIXPACKS" },
  "deploy": { "startCommand": "npm start", "healthcheckPath": "/health" }
}
```

Update root `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm run client:build && npm run server:build",
    "client:build": "cd client && npm ci && npm run build",
    "server:build": "cd server && npm ci && npm run build",
    "start": "cd server && npm start",
    "postinstall": "cd server && npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy"
  }
}
```

Push updates:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Railway configuration"
git push origin main
```

**🎉 Your app is now live!** Access at your Railway URL and create your account.

**Cost:** ~$5/month

### 🔒 Security Note
- Your `.env` file is automatically ignored by Git and won't be uploaded
- Always use your own email and secure passwords
- Never commit sensitive information to GitHub

### 💼 **For Employers Viewing This Repository**
This repository demonstrates:
- **Clean, production-ready code** with comprehensive documentation
- **Full development lifecycle** from planning to deployment
- **Modern development practices** including testing, CI/CD, and security
